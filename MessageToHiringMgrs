Hi! I'm still figuring out GitHub, this file will be to tell you details of my implementation.
So far I have a working tic-tac-toe but it's a little kludgy. I'll submit a few more times while I clean it up.

I implemented a rule set rather than going through every possible move and selecting the winning/tieing choices.
